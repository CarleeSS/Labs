        <p>Vine was an American social media platform where users could upload self-made videos and subscribe to other users' content. The videos were limited to 6-second loops and could be shared and uploaded on other social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook. The platform's offiical release was January 24, 2013, and Twitter purchased it the year before. Vine videos typically consisted of humor in nature and encompassed a mass range of comedy. The main form of followers and users on the platform was Millenials and Gen Z generations, hence the content followed those generations' style of humor. By December 2015, Vine had over 200 million active users and was wildly popular. In October of 2016, Twitter announced they'd be disabling the uploading part of Vine, though users could still view, share, and download videos. The reason for the discontinuation was mainly due to marketeers leaving and monetary sources transferring to longer video forms. Use of Vine greatly decreased after the 2016 discontinuation, though archived videos and compilations can still be found on YouTube and other platforms. As of 2022, Vine was closed and put into an "archival state".</p>
