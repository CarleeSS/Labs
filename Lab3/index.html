    <h2>About Mini Aussies</h2>
    <p>Mini Aussies are a small version of the Australian Sheperd. They also have another size called toy aussie. Aussies are one of the smartest dog breeds in the world, consistently ranked in the top 100. They are also closely related to the number 1 smartest breed in the world, which is the border collie. Funnily, aussies are commonly mistaken for border collies in public. They are extremely energetic, as they are a hearding breed, and require lots of activity and/or stimulation. Yet, they are also adatpable, able to live in a city apartment or country farmhouse. They are great for families as they are very social dogs and are easily trainable.<br>The australian sheperd itself was bred in a region called Basque, between France and Spain, not in Australia as their name suggests. That came from the herders who used the breed for sheep and livestock herding, most came from Australia. The mini aussie was officially bred in the 1960s in California. All they did was shrink the aussie into a smaller size, while maintaing its traits, such as herding, loyalty, intelligence, affection, and trainability.</p>
