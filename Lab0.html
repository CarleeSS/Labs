        <h2>Creative Writing</h2>
        <p>My dream job is to be an author.</p>
        <h3>Senior</h3>
        <p>I've been told if I want to be an author, I should make my own website where I can put my writing on. So, hopefully this class will help me to understand that. I also hope this class will teach me more about computers because as a writer I use computers a lot but I've never been that good at using them.</p>
        <h4>My Favorite Things</h4>
        <p>My favorite things are my dog (his name is Otis), my family, reading, writing, biking, hiking, and working out.</p>
